## Football talent scouting network strategy : A Data Analysis of key elements that drive high return on investment in setting up a football talent scouting network focussing on high growth players
In this analysis, I explored the FIFA 22 dataset, focussing on parameters that could help identify challenges and opportunities as well as limitations of a deterministic data based approach.

### üìä **Executive Summary**
The project provides a comprehensive framework for identifying and analyzing football talent. It offers insights into scouting efficiency, player performance metrics, and regional scouting priorities. 
The interactive visualizations enable users to evaluate key data-driven strategies for optimizing scouting networks. This tool is ideal for clubs and analysts aiming to enhance their recruitment processes through actionable insights.



### üéØ **Key Findings**
1. **Where do top players play ?** Most top current players play in UK and western europe with USA rounding off the top 5 and that is where the most valuable football leagues are.
2. **Underrepresented nationalities** Brazil is in the top 5 most valuable nationalities but most valuable players from Brazil are playing in the european leagues reflecting a mismatch between early talent and long term opportunities.
3. **Player current level vs valuation** The value growth of players compared to their current overall follows an exponential curve meaning that there are potentially big financial rewards for growing football talent which is in line with the assumption of our initial assumptions.
4. **Age and Growth relationship** Age has an inverse relationship with room for growth meaning we are more likley to find higher talent potential in younger players.

This repository includes:
* A comprehensive set of notebooks that serve as the base of the analysis.
* Supporting files such as the project introduction and detailed methodology.

### üí° **Data Sources**
This project was conducted as part of the Data Analytics Career Program I'm enrolled in. I independently sourced and prepared the datasets, focusing on cleaning the data to ensure unique sets were characterized by their IDs, skills and attributes, and aggregated potential information. I also added a few calculated fields like growth room , growth room % which help us in understanding the players from our project perspective.
